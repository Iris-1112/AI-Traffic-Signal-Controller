## Vision & Goals
Urban traffic congestion remains a persistent challenge, causing excessive vehicle wait times, fuel wastage, and environmental pollution. Traditional fixed-timer signals are rigid and blind to real-world, stochastic traffic patterns. This project replaces these outdated systems with an intelligent, autonomous controller that adapts in real-time. 

*"Empowering smarter city infrastructure, one dynamic intersection at a time."*

## Solution Highlights
* **AI-Powered Adaptation** – A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that perceives real-time intersection states to dynamically alter signal phases.
* **Massive Delay Reduction** – Achieved a 75% reduction in commuter delays (dropping average wait times from 78.5s to 18.2s).
* **Emergency Preemption** – A deterministic hybrid override module that slashes ambulance wait times from a fatal 120 seconds down to just 3 seconds.
* **High-Fidelity Simulation** – Built on the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) engine, leveraging real-world map data for rigorous testing.

## Architecture Overview

| Layer | Purpose | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simulation Engine** | High-fidelity, microscopic traffic physics and real-world map routing. | SUMO, OpenStreetMap (OSM) |
| **Core AI Agent** | Processes state representations (queue length, wait times) to select optimal signal phases. | Python 3, TensorFlow / Keras |
| **Integration API** | The live, bi-directional feedback loop bridging the AI agent and the simulation environment. | TraCI (Traffic Control Interface) |
| **Dashboard (Planned)** | Client-facing interface for city planners to monitor KPIs like intersection throughput. | Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib |

## Getting Started
